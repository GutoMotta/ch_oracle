# Choracle
Choracle is a chord recognition program. It uses [LibROSA](https://github.com/librosa/librosa) for audio processing.

The chord recognition algorithm used is described on chapter 5 of [Fundamentals of Music Processing](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319219448).

To evaluate the algorithm, [Chris Harte's PhD thesis'](https://code.soundsoftware.ac.uk/attachments/download/330/chris_harte_phd_thesis.pdf)The Beatles chords [annotations](http://isophonics.net/content/reference-annotations-beatles) were used as ground truth data.
